# utils #
There are "maket.cpp", "stress_test.cpp" and "mytemplate.cpp".
My template of code in mytemplate.cpp (!!!)
I use "maket" for fast create file with template. Also i have "makecf"/"makegen" for create file with codeforces template and generator template (for stress-testing)
For create file need 1 arg - name of file. "maket nameOfFile" create "nameOfFile.cpp".
"stress-test" i use for stress-testing(!!!). "stress-test NAME_OF_GENERATOR NAME_OF_TRUE_SOLUTION NAME_OF_WRONG_SOLUTION" run program for input quantity of iterations. Any iterations util run "NAME_OF_GENERATOR RAND_SEED". After, first run "NAME_OF_TRUE_SOLUTION", second - "NAME_OF_WRONG_SOLUTION". If their output is not equal program stop and output: test, true answer, wrong answer, else program go to next iteration.
